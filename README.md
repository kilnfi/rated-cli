```

## Building & Running

```
make
bin/rated-cli --config config.yaml watch
```

## Features

### Grafana

If you are running it in an environment with Prometheus & Grafana, you can
install the ready-to-use dashboard in Grafana by:

- clicking on the `+` icon on the left menu and selecting `Import`,
- pasting the [JSON](grafana/dashboard.json) and clicking the `Load` button.

You will end up with a similar-looking dashboard:

### Watcher

The watcher watches a list of validation keys and exposes their metrics to an
endpoint to be polled by Prometheus. This allows to implement blackbox
monitoring on an Ethereum Validation infrastructure without relying on internal
signals, independant of the Ethereum clients used.
